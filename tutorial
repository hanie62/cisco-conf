You can connect WAN interfaces either by using straight polarity connectors or reversed polarity connectors.

Straight Polarity: If Mag-jack RJ45 connector has a dot or digit marked on front housing, it can be used with any type of cables.
Reversed Polarity: If Mag-jack RJ45 connector has no dots or digit marked on front housing, it can be used with coupler and short cable (Cat5E UTP cable) to connect other devices which doesnâ€™t support auto polarity correction.
To configure Gigabit Ethernet (GE) WAN interfaces, follow these steps, beginning in global configuration mode.
